This file is used for extracting features over windows of tri-axial accelerometer
data. We recommend using helper functions like _compute_mean_features(window) to
extract individual features.

As a side note, the underscore at the beginning of a function is a Python
convention indicating that the function has private access (although in reality
it is still publicly accessible).
